                        Last summer I had a sudden change of heart about summer professional opportunities. Somehow I was able to gain a brief moment of clarity, stopped comparing myself to my peers or any conception of what I thought I should be doing, and picked up my things to move to Seattle for, what seemed like, no apparent reason. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I didn't have an agenda or plan, I just had a feeling I needed to be on my own. During my three month stint there I did a lot, but also not a lot. Sometimes for days my only words spoken would be my coffee order. Some days I would just sit outside a cafe and finish a book in one sitting. Other days I would get takeout and eat at Discovery Park just because. If I wrote down everything I physically did while in Seattle the list wouldn't be too long. Today, if you asked me why I moved to Seattle for no reason for a summer I would tell you it would be to be alone. I'm a extroverted son of Vietnamese refugees — by nature I depend on the energy of others, contradictory isn't it? Retroactively, I realized I craved to be alone because I felt that I was stagnating. I was growing, but didn't know to what end. If I was always feeding off of the energy others, I could theoretically infinitely distract myself. This scared me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a city I'd never been to, didn't know anyone, and with no plan I sat with myself to find my North Star. Towards the end of my trip I didn't have a particular moment of clarity or epiphany, just a warm feeling that I was doing the right thing. That's all I needed. I was able to step back, take it all in, then jump and I haven't regretted a moment since. Because of this, I've been able to do things I previously wouldn't have had the confidence in my direction to do so.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A direct nugget of information I found out while living in Seattle was that my last name means "river" in Vietnamese (I blame the fact that it took me 20 years to learn that on identity suppression rooted in colonialism and racism, definitely not my fault for not asking earlier...). My North Star, it turns out, is my inherent need to build community — much like rivers have done over millennia. Not just build community but also rebuild communities that have been torn apart by forces such as war, colonialism, capitalism, and other unjust, inequitable systems. Specifically, my goal is to bridge the Acculturation Gap — the gap that occurs in immigrant and refugee communities when children of immigrants are faced with the dichotomy between their heritage and the culture of their new environment. Ideally, I want to mitigate the melting pot of negative effects that come with youth maladjustment as a direct result of the Acculturation Gap.

                        I could go on and on about what I've learned (ideally over a shared meal), but I'll move on with this: My name is Richard Ton Giang and I'm driven by deep empathy, awe-inspiring stories, community (re)building, and the promise of creative collaboration.

                        I've had the unique opportunity to develop a perspective fueled by a parental refugee experience, being the "other" in predominantly white institutions, a society where Asian-Americanness is breaching mainstream, and belonging to the first generation to grow up with ubiquitous tech. I've learned there are definitely pros and cons to it all, but I've created something that I wouldn't trade the world for. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've crafted a way of being creative that's built on a system of a source, a desired outcome, and flexibly hybrid mediums.

                    <h1>THE SOURCE</h1>
                    <p>
                        The source is immigrants stories, methods, and practices built on thousands of years of innovation. From observing my mom to reading articles about immigrant stories, I've found the ways that immigrants have adjusted to living in the United States a source of inspiration for different ways to think, feel, and design.

                    <h1>THE DESIRED OUTCOME</h1>
                    <p>
                        
                        The desired outcome is based in a theory I learned in my human-computer interaction curriculum: Expectancy Violations Theory. The theory explores how humans respond to unanticipated violations of social norms and expecations. While this can be negative or positive, of course in my work, my goal is to produce wholly positive experiences that change perspectives for the better of all stakeholders. Essentially, I want people to interact with the stories I produce and say to themselves, "Woah, I never thought about it like that!"

                    <h1>THE MEDIUM</h1>
                    <p>
                        It isn't any specific one, I'm open to finding what works best for each story. However, I have a strong belief that bridging the gap between digital and physical spaces can produce experiences that are inherently more novel and rewarding compared to what could be achieved with just one or the other (think interactive websites or augmented reality).

                        I'm glad you asked. Of course, as you may have noticed, I'm intuitively drawn towards food and food stories. Whether it's planning trips around meals with my cousins using Yelp or listening to David Chang's and Chris Ying's "Recipe Club" podcast on drives home, I can't help but find joy in food culture. Growing up, food was the only part of my culture I wasn't ashamed of (after I got over my "lunchbox stories"), so I of course I like to indulge in all of the goodness that comes from food which is often much more than just eating.

                        Outside of stuffing my face in every big city or small town I've been to, I love adventuring whether it's summitting Mount Angeles in Olympic National Park with only running shoes, kayaking in the open ocean, or even just exploring a new city, I'm always craving the new and novel, and true to my extroverted tendencies I much prefer doing it all with loved ones (or strangers, new members of my chosen family are always welcome).  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My hobbies have been all over but what stays consistent is reading books whose covers catch my eye (contrary to that childhood proverb, I do judge books by their covers — I'm sorry but I'm a sucker for good cover design!), going to coffee shops (pourover please), and adding posts to my interior design collections on Instagram (Japanese-inspired or Mid-Century Modern).

                        Whenever someone asks who I am outside of my work that's always interesting to me because sometimes I believe that work and life need to be completely separate and other times I subscribe to the notion that enjoyable work can be your life. Regardless, I think if I'm driven by my values there will probably be underlying themes across everything.
