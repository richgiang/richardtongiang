            I have a few tools in my toolbox that can help me formalize my initial approach to the work I would be doing at IDEO.org, but of course I'm always trying to expand it while improving current tools.

                    My junior year of college I took a class called "Art 3001: Internet Art" for my Studio Art minor. What drew me to it was the promise of learning HTML/CSS/JS. I can safely say that this was one of my favorite classes and one that I spent the most time working on projects for, well, because it was fun. What I didn't expect to get was a sense of wonderment inspired by my two professors. They were a couple of MFA grads from UCLA who came to Ohio State to teach temporarily during the height of the pandemic. As a team they worked perfectly. Dalena Tran was a perfectly attentive teacher who was patient with us and encouraged us to expand our borders and look everywhere for inspiration â€” a true artist. Hirad Sab was a genius at really any digital medium (3D Modeling, animation, creative coding, you name it), he showed us what creative wonderment could tangibly manifest as and how we could execute on our visions. During this class I fell in love with the possibilities of creative coding and how I can bring stories to life on a computer screen.

                    This project was an assignment for my Internet Art class and my first exploration outside of the content we were learning in class. I collaborated with my now-friend Christian Harris. We both recognized each other's desire to go above and beyond and really get more out of class so we petitioned to our professors to collaborate on projects and they enthusiastically approved. For this project, we had a vision to tell the story of the duality of Columbus' demographic disparity. We found that there was a lot of disparate data that detailed the effects of redlining in Columbus and wanted to bring it to light in a thought-provoking, cohesive way.

                <p>
                    The way we went about telling the story of the data we found was in the form of multiple maps. Our delivery of the information took the form of a topographic map with more maps with detailed data available as the user explores the "terrain". The reason we chose topographic maps was because of their specific use to understand elevation differences. We thought this would be a perfect parallel to the inequitable and unjust differences of resource availability across race in Columbus. In Columbus, there's a specific contrast between where white folks live and where Black folks live which was the central dichotomy we were highlighting, then we drilled further by highlighting certain markers for livelihood such as education attainment, city green space projects, etc.

                    We split the website into two main pages, the first being Good City which details the surface-level highlights of what Columbus is doing well for their residents. The markers we detailed were Public Spaces, Unemployment, and Celebrate One (a green space inititative). Essentially, what we wanted to bring attention to was the fact that the effects area of these initiatives and markers were city wide and not concentrated in any one area. Contrastingly, for Bad City we drilled into Education Attainment, Where White Folks Live, and Where Black Folks Live. Here, we wanted visitors to see that there was a stark difference in where each demographic lived and how education attainment was correlated directly to those differences (higher education attainment in areas with more white folks and lower in areas with more Black folks).

                <p>
                    Throughout this process, we wanted to acknowledge that neither of us shared an identity with the population we were highlighting (the Black and African-American population). To account for this, we ensured that our sources were as unbiased, objective and accurate as possible, and that we were cross-checking all of our information so as not to accidentally misrepresent information. We also consulted our professors on best practices since they had some expertise in how to account for identity in art pieces. My regret is that throughout the process we didn't take time to talk to the Black folks who lived in the areas that we were highlighting. If I were to expand on and revisit this piece, that'd be the first thing I would do.

                    This project was chosen to be represented in a digital art show where student pieces were highlighted and promoted to the public.
