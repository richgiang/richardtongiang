            Why I get so much value from storytelling

            I'm always crafting my work around the stories of folks that inspire it, so I'm stoked about a role where the job <i>is</i> storytelling. Here are some thoughts about why I think I'm capable of creating value in this role.

                It still blows my mind how the creators of <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i> were able to produce such strong emotions from just a scene of rocks with googley eyes and onscreen text. This whole film exemplifies the empathetic reaction I'd love to reproduce in my own work.

                    Storytelling for me starts long before I was born. Something I try to remind myself whenever I feel doubts about my identity and how I fit into my environment, I remember a quote from Eddie Huang (writer of "Fresh of the Boat") that he said during a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1SY2BjsJ0TmqA12e4e3PME" target="_blank"><u>podcast</u></a>,
                    

                    <div class="block-quote | padding3">
                        "I remember being a kid, got picked on all the time, but my dad always told me, 'you belong to a civilization that's 5,000 years-old. We are the first unit of our family born in America, we've never been here.' And he was like, 'Whenever you get down, just remember that you're part of something that is 5,000 years-old. It was here before you, it will be here after you... always stay connected."
                    </div>
                    
                    
                    Hearing this quote made me reflect on why I've chosen to go down the path I have and why I love storytelling. I've been given the opportunity that not many people in our family's history (or really the history of Vietnamese Americans) have. Because of this, my drive stems from the opportunities that lie within elevating the voices that never had or will have the chance to tell their own stories. While my <a href="/archived-code/about-me.html" target="_blank"><u>North Star</u></a> may be bridging the Acculturation Gap, my vehicle to get there is elevating the stories of others in a way that gives them agency to co-create their own narrative. Armed with 5,000+ years of rich culture and a new perspective I'm ready to pursue whatever opportunities and stories come my way.

                <p>
                    In the past, this drive towards equity and inclusivity manifested itself early with my first social justice involvement raising money towards providing educational materials for children in rural Ethiopia while in high school. Simultaneously, my skills had their beginnings while in my high school's journalism program — I combined design and storytelling to produce layouts that not only highlighted the humanity of those being interviewed, but augmented it with visuals to create a holistically immersive experience in an attempt to elicit deep empathy from readers. Across all of this, my biggest takeaways was a basis in storytelling, and the ability to ask the right questions.

                <p>
                    Armed with the skill intentional questioning, I pursued a degree in human-computer interaction, seeking out the motivations behind human behavior and how to use that to help better get to the root of stories.  Because of this, today, what I'm confident in is the ability to tell a good story through whatever medium is appropriate be that through interactive websites, 3D modeling, or clever experiences that bridge the digital and physical worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With intentional questioning and an understanding of behavior, I dove into introspection that helped me define my own story. The result of this lies in my TEDx talk in which I became vulnerable on stage about Identity Imposter Syndrome in the hopes of getting others to reflect on their own stories. The resulting response from my talk helped me realize the importance of transparency in eliciting empathy. I realized that if I could create a connection between

                    In all honesty, from what I've gathered based on my research of IDEO.org and the wildly talented collective that makes up the studio coupled with my understanding of the job posting, I am most likely far less experienced than the other candidates being considered. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, from what I also know about IDEO.org and the IDEO culture broadly, I understand that the perspective is that experience does not necessarily equate to role fit. Additionally, I know that IDEO.org doesn't extend the opportunity to interview to just anyone. It's clear to me that something from my lived experiences resonated with those who looked at my application. In this collection of thoughts, I've tried to highlight what I believe was resonated with so as to provide more context in the hopes of confirming any beliefs about my ability to succeed in this role. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Candidly, I'm very much in the early stages of transitioning from the "Learning" to "Fluency" phase of the Learning to Fluency to Teaching pipeline outlined in the Little Book of IDEO — I have a lot I want to learn still. 
                    
                    Something that really empathized with me during my research was the idea of "Learning by doing". If I was asked how I would address my lack of experience compared to the other candidates it would be exactly that — learning by doing, experimenting, failing, reflecting, internalizing, and looking forward to new opportunities. When I look at the list of desired skills, I can draw parallels between only some of them and what I've been able to learn and explore so far in my short career. I'm only barely getting started and I'm relentlessly pursuing the possibilities of what I feel and know is to come. What I do know how to do is find the most inspiring parts of every story, and convert them into experiences that produce empathy — whatever medium that takes doesn't matter to me, hearing and telling stories is just holistically fulfilling to me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't think I've ever turned down a challenge simply because I didn't know how to do something. My reason for this is because I know that on the other end there's a story and whole world waiting to be explored and changed for the better. I value looking those stories and worlds in the eyes more than I'm afraid of failing. With that, if given the chance, I wouldn't look back — I'd love to learn and fail while producing perspective-shifting stories at IDEO.org.
