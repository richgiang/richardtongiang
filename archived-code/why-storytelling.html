            Why I get so much value from storytelling

            I'm always crafting my work around the stories of folks that inspire it, so I'm stoked about a role where the job <i>is</i> storytelling. Here are some thoughts about why I think I'm capable of creating value in this role.

                It still blows my mind how the creators of <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i> were able to produce such strong emotions from just a scene of rocks with googley eyes and onscreen text. This whole film exemplifies the empathetic reaction I'd love to reproduce in my own work.

                <p>
                    Storytelling for me starts long before I was born. Something I try to remind myself whenever I feel doubts about my identity and how I fit into my environment, I remember a quote from Eddie Huang (writer of "Fresh of the Boat") that he said during a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1SY2BjsJ0TmqA12e4e3PME" target="_blank"><u>podcast</u></a>,
                    

                    <div class="block-quote | padding3">
                        "I remember being a kid, got picked on all the time, but my dad always told me, 'you belong to a civilization that's 5,000 years-old. We are the first unit of our family born in America, we've never been here.' And he was like, 'Whenever you get down, just remember that you're part of something that is 5,000 years-old. It was here before you, it will be here after you... always stay connected."
                    </div>
                    
                    
                    Hearing this quote made me reflect on why I've chosen to go down the path I have and why I love storytelling. I've been given the opportunity that not many people in our family's history (or really the history of Vietnamese Americans) have. Because of this, my drive stems from the opportunities that lie within elevating the voices that never had or will have the chance to tell their own stories. While my <a href="/archived-code/about-me.html" target="_blank"><u>North Star</u></a> may be bridging the Acculturation Gap, my vehicle to get there is elevating the stories of others in a way that gives them agency to co-create their own narrative. Armed with 5,000+ years of rich culture and a new perspective I'm ready to pursue whatever opportunities and stories come my way. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the past, this drive towards equity and inclusivity manifested itself early with my first social justice involvement raising money towards providing educational materials for children in rural Ethiopia while in high school. Simultaneously, my skills had their beginnings while in my high school's journalism program — I combined design and storytelling to produce layouts that not only highlighted the humanity of those being interviewed, but augmented it with visuals to create a holistically immersive experience in an attempt to elicit deep empathy from readers. Across all of this, my biggest takeaways was a basis in storytelling, and the ability to ask the right questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Armed with the skill intentional questioning, I pursued a degree in human-computer interaction, seeking out the motivations behind human behavior and how to use that to help better get to the root of stories.  Because of this, today, what I'm confident in is the ability to tell a good story through whatever medium is appropriate be that through interactive websites, 3D modeling, or clever experiences that bridge the digital and physical worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With intentional questioning and an understanding of behavior, I dove into introspection that helped me define my own story. The result of this lies in my TEDx talk in which I became vulnerable on stage about Identity Imposter Syndrome in the hopes of getting others to reflect on their own stories. The resulting response from my talk helped me realize the importance of transparency in eliciting empathy. I realized that if I could create a connection between two entities in a moment of vulnerability, I could get people to use stories as a mirror for empathetic reflection rather than just a window into someone else's life.

                    Today, I'm applying my knowledge of storytelling methods, intentional questioning, and human behavior through the lens of my 5,000+ year history to empower organizations to find and uncover their own stories.

                    What the currently looks like is designing for startups in the Columbus area (via Relay Product Collective). Whether it's UI/UX, responsive web design, user research, branding, or general design strategy, my goal is to show them the power of amplifying their stories using human-centered design.

                    My personal design history is quite all over the place, I'll admit. To be honest, I love being a beginner at something. The novelty of finding how I can take a software, method, or tool and make it my own by applying my perspective to it will never wear off. Of course, I have my favorites (print and visual design, interactive web design, photography, and good 'ol writing) but I don't think I've ever shied away for learning anything new if the circumstances, constraints, or stories call for it.

                <p>
                    Currently I'm larning React.JS to help me expand my ability to create website with lasting impressions. Overall, my goal is to speed up my processess so I can efficiently iterate, learn, and execute on designs that help people at the root of their needs. As far as 2D/3D animation, my basis in 3D modeling using Maya and ZBrush has given me what I need to explore animation, lighting, and producing human-inspired projects which I'm excited to get into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, at the end of my 3D modeling class I produced a monument dedicated to the Vietnamese fishing community who lost their homes in Seadrift, Texas due to the domestic terrorissm of the Klu Klux Klan. This was inspired by a script that I wrote for a screenwriting class detailing a fictional account of the events of 1979. For me, everything is connected, and I'm always looking for the most inspiring ways to tell new and old stories.

                My approach to problem solving
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                <p>
                    In any organization that I'm a part of I try to bring a culture of shared discovery. What I'm learning becomes what my teammates are learning through collaborative problem solving sessions and sending link after link in Slack channels. Most recently, I inspired my teammates in Relay to enroll in the Google UX Design Certificate program through Coursera so we can individually learn a shared framework then synthesize our learning using our own unique perspectives towards the goal of finding a collectively new way to apply what we're learning. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had to answer how I best collaborate I would say that it would be through intentional questions as a means to catalyze collaboration. My journalistic roots (and old journalism advisor's voice) echo through my brain telling me to ask the "right" questions at the "right" time. Follow-up questions are my specialty so I'm always looking for ways to pivot, zoom out, zoom in, or back track to make sure we're getting to the ideal answer while ensuring it stays on track towards our collective North Star, whatever that may be at the time. My favorite collabroation sessions are when there's a back and forth that builds to a crescendo and a moment of silence that indicates clarity — like the fog clearing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, during a meeting with my co-founders for Grains (a community product that seeks to help people be more intentional with how they approach their food), we took a step back and wanted to fully take in something one of our creators had said (a recipe creator). She expressed that plenty of people like us come up to creators like her and talk about money, but her goal was never to make money in the first place. She wanted to take back her means for creation — she wants to create food content for the sake of creating food content. I interjected with the question: "What if our goal was anti-making money?" Then our conversation snowballed into something that us and the users we've been talking to were happy with (a conversation for later). Regardless, at the end of the day, I love asking "What if?" at any point in the process.

                This is how we celebrated our first issue being published when I was design coordinator for our high school paper. When I entered university I didn't think I'd stick with journalism, but 6 years after taking my first journalism class I became the Managing Editor for Design for our university newspaper. Funny how things work out.

                    In all honesty, from what I've gathered based on my research of IDEO.org and the wildly talented collective that makes up the studio coupled with my understanding of the job posting, I am most likely far less experienced than the other candidates being considered. Simultaneously, after my conversation with Chloe, I can already begin to grasp how much growing I should be doing. Her thoughtful questions, responses, and reflections on my answers gave me insight into how confident everyone at IDEO.org is in their ability to contribute to creative, social justice, and interpersonal work. Not just pure confidence in ability, but rather confidence in their position within the setting that they're in. Really, a lack of a fear of failing. These are also also spaces I'm learning and unlearning in. I'm a work in progress, I know this, but I also know that I want to progress by any means necessary. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    From what I also know about IDEO.org and the IDEO culture broadly, I understand that the perspective is that experience does not necessarily equate to role fit. Additionally, I know that IDEO.org doesn't extend the opportunity to interview to just anyone. It's clear to me that something from my lived experiences resonated with those who looked at my application. In this collection of thoughts, I've tried to highlight what I believe was resonated with so as to provide more context in the hopes of confirming any beliefs about my ability to succeed in this role. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Candidly, I'm very much in the early stages of transitioning from the "Learning" to "Fluency" phase of the Learning to Fluency to Teaching pipeline outlined in the Little Book of IDEO — I have a lot I want to learn still. 
                    
                    Something that really empathized with me during my research was the idea of "Learning by doing". If I was asked how I would address my lack of experience compared to the other candidates it would be exactly that — learning by doing, experimenting, failing, reflecting, internalizing, and looking forward to new opportunities. When I look at the list of desired skills, I can draw parallels between only some of them and what I've been able to learn and explore so far in my short career. I'm only barely getting started and I'm relentlessly pursuing the possibilities of what I feel and know is to come. What I do know how to do is find the most inspiring parts of every story, and convert them into experiences that produce empathy — whatever medium that takes doesn't matter to me, hearing and telling stories is just holistically fulfilling to me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't think I've ever turned down a challenge simply because I didn't know how to do something. My reason for this is because I know that on the other end there's a story and whole world waiting to be explored and changed for the better. I value looking those stories and worlds in the eyes more than I'm afraid of failing. With that, if given the chance, I wouldn't look back — I'd love to learn and fail while producing perspective-shifting stories at IDEO.org.
