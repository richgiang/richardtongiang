            Why I get so much value from storytelling

            I'm always crafting my work around the stories of folks that inspire it, so I'm stoked about a role where the job <i>is</i> storytelling. Here are some thoughts about why I think I'm capable of creating value in this role.

                It still blows my mind how the creators of <i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i> were able to produce such strong emotions from just a scene of rocks with googley eyes and onscreen text. This whole film exemplifies the empathetic reaction I'd love to reproduce in my own work.

                    In all honesty, from what I've gathered based on my research of IDEO.org and the wildly talented collective that makes up the studio coupled with my understanding of the job posting, I am most likely far less experienced than the other candidates being considered. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, from what I also know about IDEO.org and the IDEO culture broadly, I understand that the perspective is that experience does not necessarily equate to role fit. Additionally, I know that IDEO.org doesn't extend the opportunity to interview to just anyone. It's clear to me that something from my lived experiences resonated with those who looked at my application. In this collection of thoughts, I've tried to highlight what I believe was resonated with so as to provide more context in the hopes of confirming any beliefs about my ability to succeed in this role. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Candidly, I'm very much in the early stages of transitioning from the "Learning" to "Fluency" phase of the Learning to Fluency to Teaching pipeline outlined in the Little Book of IDEO — I have a lot I want to learn still. 
                    
                    Something that really empathized with me during my research was the idea of "Learning by doing". If I was asked how I would address my lack of experience compared to the other candidates it would be exactly that — learning by doing, experimenting, failing, reflecting, internalizing, and looking forward to new opportunities. When I look at the list of desired skills, I can draw parallels between only some of them and what I've been able to learn and explore so far in my short career. I'm only barely getting started and I'm relentlessly pursuing the possibilities of what I feel and know is to come. What I do know how to do is find the most inspiring parts of every story, and convert them into experiences that produce empathy — whatever medium that takes doesn't matter to me, hearing and telling stories is just holistically fulfilling to me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't think I've ever turned down a challenge simply because I didn't know how to do something. My reason for this is because I know that on the other end there's a story and whole world waiting to be explored and changed for the better. I value looking those stories and worlds in the eyes more than I'm afraid of failing. With that, if given the chance, I wouldn't look back — I'd love to learn and fail while producing perspective-shifting stories at IDEO.org.
