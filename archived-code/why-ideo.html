            After reading the bios of all 64 creatives at IDEO.org and reading the case studies they've poured empathy, powerful design, and people-centric practices into, I can say that I'm wildly excited about the possibilities of contributing my own story to IDEO.org's work and culture.

                    As I've combed through IDEO.org's digital footprint, I've gradually become more and more excited about the possibility of contributing my perspective to IDEO.org's current body of work. In addition, the opportunity to create practices and discover principles to be reproduced and refined in the future gets me excited. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, the principles of finding hope in human stories, being more powerful together, taking mistakes in stride, and getting a little messy when not knowing all of the answers all really resonate with me and how I've developed my style as a designer and storyteller.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more I read about perspectives, employee bios, and the impact report, the more alignment I see with how I design and tell stories — it's a bit uncanny. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I'm hoping to contribute to the culture and body of work is my perspective as a son of Vietnamese refugees who values learning stories over a shared meeal. My emotional intelligence allows me to strike a delicate balance when working directly with users. My

                    If I were to work at IDEO.org I would make it a point to get food with as many people in the organization as I could and learn about their own stories, but these folks stories particularly stuck out to me.

                <h1>Emily Sadeghian</h1>
                <p>
                    Emily's article titled "The Material Effects of Stories", ties directly into my design philosophy of producing positive interactions as a result of Expectancy Violations Theory. I'd love to tap into her deep knowledge of storytelling as a writer to help me better formalize my writing practices — something I've been meaning to work on. Her empathetic abilities are evident in her writing, and I'd love to share a conversation over film and vintage store shopping.

                <p>
                    I listened to the 'Good UX' chat that Justine participated in and got great insight into how IDEO.org works behind the scenes. Her perspective in valuing the supportive nature of everyone in the organization is something I really resonate with and I'd like to learn about what she has learned from the wealth of knowledge she's gathered. I'd also love to learn about her experience with startups since I'm also coming from that world!

                <p>
                    Everyone at IDEO.org likely has a worldly perspective due to the nature of the work, but I was particularly drawn to Shesley's mix of background. His work as an artist in Mauritius is incredibly interesting to me and as a fellow photographer I'd love to learn about what he has seen through his lens. Overall, I'd be interested to learn about his latest hobby or his work in Nepal.
