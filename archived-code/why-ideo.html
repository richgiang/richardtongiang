            After reading the bios of all 64 creatives at IDEO.org and reading the case studies they've poured empathy, powerful design, and people-centric practices into, I can say that I'm wildly excited about the possibilities of contributing my own story to IDEO.org's work and culture.

                <p class="callout">
                    I took some time to reflect after my call with Chloe about what my "Why" is. In the moment I don't think I delivered the kind of answer that I would be satisfied with if I was on Chloe's end. In preparing to answer that question I figured it would be similar to other companies in the idea that candidates are expected to talk about what they would contribute to the company. However, listening to what Chloe said after I answered the question, I realize it's something much more important due to the nature of the work being done at IDEO.org. Hearing about IDEO.org's collective "Why" and how each individual "Why" contributes to it, I wanted to think more deeply of my own. Here's what I arrived at: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "What" doesn't change — the principles and methods stay relatively the same (albeit optimized and scaled in ideal future states) but what does change is the why. The why should be as unique as each population of human stories we engage with. With that in mind, what makes IDEO.org so ideal for me is that my north star of empowering immigrants and refugees by providing them the agency to tell their own stories aligns really well with the “What". I'm excited because of the seemingly endless possibilities of the "Why's" that I'll continuously come to learn, appreciate, and internalize to help better inform future storytelling endeavors. My reason for investing my attention, care, and creativity will probably evolve project to project, year to year, but what won't waver is my desire to  tell the stories that go undeservedly untold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Internally, what drives me is the possibility and comfort in knowing that if I'm able to change “a world” (and not always necessarily just focusing on “the world”, although on a high-level that's still what we're always working towards). I'm making progress towards giving those that have been historically and systemically excluded the opportunity to form their own 5,000+ year history rich with culture, tradition, and joy. For me, it's not a matter of "if" but "when" and I'd love to have IDEO.org's wealth of knowledge, perspectives, and care contribute to the stories that I'm set on telling and changing for the better.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I've combed through IDEO.org's digital footprint, I've gradually become more and more excited about the possibility of contributing my perspective to IDEO.org's current body of work. In addition, the opportunity to create practices and discover principles to be reproduced and refined in the future gets me excited. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically, the principles of finding hope in human stories, being more powerful together, taking mistakes in stride, and getting a little messy when not knowing all of the answers all really resonate with me and how I've developed my style as a designer and storyteller.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more I read about perspectives, employee bios, and the impact report, the more alignment I see with how I design and tell stories — it's a bit uncanny. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I'm hoping to contribute to the culture and body of work is my perspective as a son of Vietnamese refugees who values learning stories over a shared meeal.

                <p>
                    If I were to work at IDEO.org I would make it a point to get food with as many people in the organization as I could and learn about their own stories, but these folks' stories particularly stuck out to me. On my journey towards contributing while learning in the space of immigrant and refugee storytelling and community (re)building, I think their perspectives could add an incredible amount of value to the stories I'll get to co-create in the future.

                Emily's article titled "The Material Effects of Stories", ties directly into my design philosophy of producing positive interactions as a result of Expectancy Violations Theory. I'd love to tap into their deep knowledge of storytelling as a writer to help me better formalize my writing psractices — something I've been meaning to work on. Emily's storytelling is exactly the type of narrative that I'd love to translate into a digitally interactive space. Their empathetic abilities are evident in their writing, and I'd love to share a conversation over film and vintage store shopping.

Her perspective in valuing the supportive nature of everyone in the organization is something I really resonate with and I'd like to learn about what she has learned from the wealth of knowledge she's gathered. Her excitement about experimenting with different software to better deliver  I'd also love to learn about her experience with startups since I'm also coming from that world!

                <h1>Allcove</h1>
                <p>
                    When I first read Allcove, the first thing I said to myself was, "I really wish I had this in high school." Mental health both in my home and my school were things that weren't talked about really ever. I felt right back in my high school self's shoes and felt the impact of something as comprehensive as Allcove. What I resonated with is summed up well here, "Everything about the brand, from the visual language to the name, reinforces this duality of alone but not alone," this level of accommodation for younger folks in turbulent times, from a firsthand experience, make so much sense. 
                </p>
                <h3>How I can help</h3>
                <p>
                    The first question I would ask would be, "How were the students in the advisory group recruited?" I think it's important to recognize the gaps in understanding of mental health awareness across certain diverse cultures, so ensuring a diverse pool of perspectives would be crucial. I also believe it's a priority to ask questions about how, if participation was voluntary, then how could Allcove begin to cater its services to include those who don't understand the importance of mental health (due to a lack of exposure) or don't find it to be relevant (stigmatized notions of mental health in certain cultures)?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would also begin to ask about questions about accessibility and equitable access to Allcove's resources. I think in future iterations it would be crucial to anticipate how the needs of persons with disabilities would manifest, especially when interacting with the physical space. Potentially employing equitable design practicess such as creating a wider space for wheelchair access or handrails along the inner walls for support. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My plan for creating an enduring story would be to turn to those that have benefitted from Allcove already. I would work with them to create sustainable pathways and frameworks for them to continuously tell their story as it evolves. Mental health is a journey, and taking time for reflection is an important part, so I would want to give them the opportunity to help me build an online community for their reflections to live. Specifically, I would imagine this to be an interactive website where youth can upload visual artifacts detailing their lived experiences from their journey. The artifacts could be anything from doodles to video logs to photos. I'd take these artifacts and use my skills in illustration and creative coding to bring them to life. Additionally, I'd curate and develop resources to guide them through the process and tailor touchpoints between us and them to make them feel secure. What's important to me here is that the youth engaging would feel empowered to be vulnerable and share their story with the hopes of encouraging those that aren't as far along in their journeys to join the community.
