            Crash Culture is an interactive, educational trivia game that provides users with a gateway to learning more about their identity day-by-day. Each day users are provided with a singular multiple-choice trivia question about a topic within their ethnic culture from food to language and more. Beyond the game, users are encouraged to engage more deeply with their identity either via conversations with peers in their community or learning through digital resources.

                    A gap between the increasing population of second-generation immigrants and their heritage is growing and preventing them from connecting with the culture of their parents leading to dissonance between their cultural identity and their newfound American identity. Currently, there does not exist a centralized digital resource for children of immigrants to reliably learn about the varying aspects of their identities.

                I went through an entire cycle of the design process over the course of a semester to produce a mobile app concept of my own idea from empathy to testing. At the end, I made recommendations on the potential success of the app based on user data.

                    I developed insights into the problem of bridging the dichotomy of cultures for young immigrants using qualitative interviewing to produce user personas and empathy maps.

                    After honing in on a specific product and pulling from all three concepts, I produced wireframes and a click-through prototype that embodied the Crash Culture theme with the goal of gamifying cultural immersion.

In these interviews, I learned the stories of how younger immigrants are navigating the tumultuous journey of being part of a marginalized population in America. These personas are a culmination of their experiences, struggles, needs and frustrations.

                        A module-based educational platform that works with users at their own speed to dive into the history of their cultural identity that they were deprived of while growing up. Historicultural is an educational ecosystem that rewards users for their daily engagement while tracking users via "nontraditional" benchmarking such as a simple conversation with a friend about a module's topic. With this concept, I wanted to provide an educational platform that users of any level could join while still incorporating a low level of community engagement. This concept is more information heavy for those that are less inclined to cold-contact those in their community.

                <p>
                    After a class-wide review of the themes I produced in the ideation stage, I took into account feedback and developed wireframes accordingly. The winning theme was Crash Culture, but I incorporated features from all three concepts because I saw that it benefitted the medium of the Crash Culture concept while also not distracting from the core value of gamifying cultural immersion.

                <p>
                    The prototype has 5 main user flows: Onboarding, Question of the Day & Lifelines, Prompt of the Day, Friends Management, and Profile Management. All of these were made to support the goal of giving young immigrants the ability to immerse themselves in their culture and communities at their own pace while still being incentivized to return day after day.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Question of the Day helps users learn baseline, surface-level information to help them dip their toes in (Persona 1 & 3). The Lifelines nudge users to engage with the greater digital community of their culture (Persona 2). The Prompt of the Day allows for deeper connection via storytelling and discussion (Persona 2). Lastly, the additional resources found in Profile Management, gives users the base they need to dive deeper into more education (Persona 3).

                The goal of the prototype was to provide an immersive experience of the main function of Crash Culture: gamifying cultural immersion and education. I limited the user flows to remain mostly constrained so that test users would move through the prototype in a way that aligned with my testing protocol so that I could collect accurate data on specific user flows.

                <p>
                    I tested the Adobe XD prototype with five users who fit the testing requirements: young immigrants with access to technology. To do this, I created testing prototcol and conducted the tests in person, recording results and getting feedback in real time. I broke down the prototype into 6 different tasks. Based on the results of the test, I compiled my findings, made recommendations, and concluded on whether the application could prove to be successful in implementation.

                    Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned

                <p>
                    Overall, this project is the one on my portfolio I've derived the most value from on a personal level. Because it was an opportunity to pour my identity and passions into, I found myself working at it more dilligently and carefully than anything in the past. Crash Culture has taught me what project ownership can look like and how rewarding it can be. I was able to make my own decisions from empathy to testing and everything in between and implement ideas that were very representative of who I am as a person. Beyond the personal impact, I've developed new skills in Qualitative Research and Testing that I wasn't able to fully explore in my other portfolio projects due to constraints.

                            <p>
                                Because this project was so near and dear to my heart, I had to continuously remind myself to remain objective in my evaluation and synthesis of data collected at both the Empathy and Testing stages. I found myself getting lost in what the solution could look like as opposed to what my persona's needs were. To remedy this, I continously referred to exact quotes from interviews and asked for outside opinions to ensure that my work was still benefitting my intended user. Building out my user personas was essential to this process since they helped me prevent myself from falling into the Self-Referential design pitfall. I continuously adjusted my design process so that I could go back and check that my design decisions were aligning with the problems expressed in the data I collected to remain impartial.

                            <p>
                                To make this a more successful product, I would have taken more time to make the features more comprehensive in the interactive prototype prior to testing due to the fact that I felt that its limitations were preventing test users from immersing themselves in the experience I intended. This way, I would've been able to collect better data that would allow me to iterate the interactive prototype more efficiently. In addition, I would conducted more testing overall. A sample size of five users isn't enough data to make proper recommendations, so I would adapt my protocol to make the testing more accessible remotely so that I could get a larger sample size.

                                My entire life I have been lost on how exactly to navigate the dichotomy between the Vietnamese culture I was born from and the American culture I was raised in. For so long I didn't know how important it was to be able to learn and retain the rich culture of my heritage, and a big problem was a lack of acceess to tools that could help me find a starting point. It wasn't until I sought out resources myself that I realizeded how widespread the issue is and how common my story was. Seeing how every person that tested my prototype was ecstatic asbout the idea of using it in its finished form and that they wished they had something like it sooner, made me realize how important this is. My plan is to actually build out Crash Culture so that future young immigrants will have a tool to explore their culture in exactly the way they want.
