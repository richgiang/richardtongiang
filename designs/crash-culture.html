            In my "Presentation As Thinking" class for my Design Thinking minor we undertook the wicked problem of student workload and burnout in a semester-long project that taught me the value of UX Research and the process of empathy. With the overall theme of wellness at play, the top solutions from our class would be presented to Ohio State University's Chief Wellness Officer and the department chair of the Design School to be evaluated for implementation across departments.

            <p>
                Our team decided to pursue a mixed methods approach to research. Due to the breadth of the problem we needed to see what our target users, university students, associated with workload and burnout. To do this we first started with the quantiative research method of surveys to pinpoint trends that we could pursue. Over two weeks we received 117 responses and in our analysis of the data we found that the most interesting trends arose from the question "Do you feel more burnt out this semester compared to other semesters? Why or why not?" What we saw was that students were attributing feelings of burnout to a perceived surplus of unnecessary work brought on by the new virtual environment. We decided to dive deeper to these findings in qualitative interviews.

            <h1>
                Define
            </h1>
            <p>
                After discovering the trends we came together to define our problem. Between the surveys and interviews a recurring motif revolved around paint points in professor-student communication. We knew we had to narrow down the problem since there were too many avenues to pursue in the short amount of time we had. What we saw that these students were telling us was that they were looking for the most efficient means to engage with their professors to reduce instances of unneeded stress or lost time. Because of this we decided to look at the trends we found through the lens of the model of professor-student communication and we reached this problem statement:
            </p>
            <p>
                <div class="callout">
                    Students are feeling burnt out due to a perceived increase in workload which is caused by low quality interactions with their professors in a wholly digital environment.
                </div>
            </p>
            <p >
                With this problem statement we were able to narrow in on a solution space that would allow us to tackle multiple painpoints within one product. We then turned this problem statement into a "How might we?" statement:
            </p>
            <p>
                <div class="callout">
                    How might we increase the quality of interaction and communication between professors and students so that students can save time completing work for other activities that can boost their overall wellness while still receiving a high-quality education?
                </div> 
            </p> 
            <p>
                After this we broke down the central topic of our problem, professor-student communication, into a mindmap so that we could see the specificities in our wicked problem. In this mindmap we took apart the model of professor-student communication and broke it down into core functions such as Assignment Clarification, Feedback, Notification, User Availability, and more.  We then broke those categories down into specific statements of need or problems that we noticed from our surveys and interviews such as: "Notifications from current system are not helpful and often redundant" and "Communicating hours of availability outside of lecture and office hours". This gave us the clarity needed to begin brainstorming ideas for micro-solutions that address specific needs that arose from our data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we headed into ideation, to make sure we were headed down the right path we headed back into empirical research in peer-reviewed articles to see what research around the current model of professor-student communication looked like. What we found was that with email, "Professor email helpfullness, reply promptness, and email frequency for social-relationship were the most significant predictors of both professor-student relationship and teaching evaluation" (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/EC.37.3.d">Fung & Sheer, 2007</a>). From this we took away that the experience for both students and professors improves when there is a certain level of social telepresence in communication, so we thought it would be good to revamp and re-evaluate that model and the current mediums associated with it. 
            </p> 
            <p>
                The current model and medium of communication that all students at Ohio State must use to communicate with their professors: Carmen Canvas (Instructure). Within this system, professors host nearly all aspects of their courses from syllabi to assignments and quizzes to embedded media to discussion boards. While this system hosts online coursework well, it lacks interactivity that is essential to a virutal educational experience. Essentially, this system excels in being a bank of information but when used as a conduit between student in professor it lacks in any meaningful or helpful connection. 
            </p>
            <div class="documentation-photo">
                <img src="../assets/Carmen_Canvas_Screenshots-01.png" width="100%" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="documentation-text">
                <p>
                    In the current system the only time to get specific feedback on assignments between professors and students is in the comments of the specific assignment. Aside from initial feedback, professors tend to not engage with students within the comments and usually prompt them to follow-up via office hours introducing the need to externalize communication. Furthermore, the current system lends itself to a one-way feedback communication of professor-to-student only. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discussion posts are the only time to have class-wide communication, but to initiate conversation students need to go through the process of making a whole posts without being able to just send a quick message. The current practice is to use this feature for assignment-based discussions where students are graded on their "engagement" as opposed to organic communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the calendar feature, students are unable to sync, import, or share external calendars which prevents them from adding student organization, internship, research, or work calendars that may be used on other platforms. Only 3% of our respondents indicated that they solely use the Carmen Canvas calendar for organziation.
                </p>
                <div class="callout">
                    In short: There's no dedicated method of feedback from student-to-professor, discussion threads don't produce organic communication that's beneficial to students, and the calendar feature isn't fully utilized due to its lack of cross-platform integration.
                </div>

                    Within Carmen Canvas the communication between professors and students primarily exists between three features. The message inbox effectively serves as an email function in which professors and students can send mass or direct messages to specific groups or individuals. This feature fails to serve as an effective communication method due to the inability to view past messages in a thread or view messages from other individuals in the contact list. In addition, mass messsages are often spammed due to the access to group lists deterring students from actively engaging. The to-do list is an auto-populated list of assignments from all classes that are removed once submitted. This feature duplicates something that the calendar feature already does leading to unneccessary information. In addition, announcements from professors can be seen both here and on specific class pages, leading to more information duplication.

                <div class="callout">
                    In short: Notifications channels are flooded with duplicated and spam information that deters students from actively engaging with information that is actually useful leading to unneeded stressors.

            </h1>
            <p>
                After looking at all of the different pain points within student-professor communication we grouped them and began to brainstorm using the "Worst Possible Idea" method where we thought about what the worst case scenario could look like for each facet of the problem. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We then flipped our bad ideas around and turned them into their opposite which began to form ideas for features of our solution. After grouping them into categories we saw themes arise: 
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Balance in number of forms of communication.
                <br>
                2. Increased touchpoints and opportunities for communication from the professor.
                <br>
                3. Something simple and easy to use that doesn't require strong motivation and reduces time at the screen.
                <br>
                4. Access to multiple methods of collaboration between students. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From this we began to build out our vision for a comprehensive digital ecosystem that could serve as a one-stop-shop for students to answer their questions about assignments while filling in the affordances that are missed in the transition from a physical to a digital classroom. We believed that building out a "Channel" of communication similar to Slack and Discord, would allow students to communicate with professors in a more flat environment and focused on developing specific features that would be conducive to an educational context. Some specific features that arose were:
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Easy methods for booking office hour appointments
                <br>
                2. A method of feedback for individual assignments
                <br>
                3. A medium of communication for students to ask clarifying questions without compromising classroom integrity
                <br>
                4. An integrated calendar for all assignments, office hours, and events
                <br>
                5. Weekly notifications of new assignments

                Our team decided to develop a solution that serves as an augmentation to the current system. We recognized that Carmen Canvas has a robust system of coursework information storage so we merely wanted to integrate an improved method of professor-student communication and navigation of content as opposed to overhauling the entire system.

                I undertook the task of visualizing our user workflow improvement suggestions in Figma. Over the course of two weeks I taught myself how to use basic Figma functions and plug-ins and combined my knowledge of Adobe products to create a functioning prototype. The prototype helped us demonstrate various user flows where we could directly tie user needs to.

                Our professor for Exploring Design Thinking, Adam Fromme, wanted to use our final presentations in place of our "Test" portion of the design process. Our professor's goal was to collect the best projects and present our findings to both the Chair of the Design Department as well as the Chief Wellness Officer at Ohio State. We compiled our prototype and accompanying slide deck and recorded a 15 minute presentation detailing our process at each step of the design process. Our professor had to say this about our final product:

                Upon reflection two years later, I realized that this was the beginning in which I understood how important following the design process can be. Not just following it in its straightforward approach, but being able to constantly challenge assumptions while also looping through the design process in different permutations. There were many times where we learned something new through and had to open discussion back up at all parts of the process, so I quickly grasped that the design process shouldn't necessarily be a step-by-step process but rather a framework or tool to apply when confronted with information, data, and stories.
