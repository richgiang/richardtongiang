            Crash Culture is an interactive, educational trivia game that provides users with a gateway to learning more about their identity day-by-day. Each day users are provided with a singular multiple-choice trivia question about a topic within their ethnic culture from food to language and more. Beyond the game, users are encouraged to engage more deeply with their identity either via conversations with peers in their community or learning through digital resources.

                    A gap between the increasing population of second-generation immigrants and their heritage is growing and preventing them from connecting with the culture of their parents leading to dissonance between their cultural identity and their newfound American identity. Currently, there does not exist a centralized digital resource for children of immigrants to reliably learn about the varying aspects of their identities.

                I was charged with approaching the Empathy phase of this iteration of the design process with qualitative methods, particularly with interviews to help inform the building of Empathy Maps, User Personas, and Current and Future States. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I conducted 9 in-depth interviews with those in my network that identified as either second-generation immigrants or first-generation immigrants that immigrated at a young age. In these interviews, I learned the stories of how younger immigrants are navigating the tumultuous journey of being part of a marginalized population in America. These personas are a culmination of their experiences, struggles, needs and frustrations.

            <p>
                After conducting interviews and performing online research, I developed themes that corresponded to each of the personas that embodied different demographics from my research. All of the themes were inspired by diverse applications that had various functions that I believed would benefit the intended users. These themes were then presented to my UI/UX Intermedia graduate-level class where I was questioneded about my choices and given feedback. 
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>
                Derived from: Persona 1
                <br>
                <br>
                Inspired by: Wordle (a daily word game) and BeReal (a social media based in organic content creation where users only post once-per-day)
                <br>
                <br>
                What I saw: A need for a low-commitment solution that users would still be incentivized to engage with to receive bits of information about their culture that have the potential to lead to deeper engagements. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The concept: A daily trivia game about one's culture that uses "Lifelines" that nudge users to engage with their community. Crash Culture is a daily gateway for users to explore their culture and connect with other cultural community members digitally, utlizing user's pre-existing networks while also expanding them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The goal: I wanted to pull from the low-stakes commitment of a short game once per day while having the brief, yet meaningful engagement of BeReal. This way there would be a level of flexibility allowing users to choose how in-depth they'd like to immerse themselves while still being motivated to move past the scary first steps.

                <br>
                What I saw: A group of young immigrants seeking deeper, intimate, and organic connections with those in their community. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The concept: Family Ties is a mobile app that sorts out users by demographic and locality then randomly generates groupchats and assigns relevant conversation prompts once per week. Users are then incentivized to remain connected with their weekly groupchats and even meet in person via a rewards system.
                <br>
                <br>
                The goal: I wanted to nudge users to connect with those in their cultural community that they come to like in a pseudo-groupchat-platonic-speeddating setting. With this, there would be opportunities for forming deep connections with those they may not have connected with in their community.

                <br>
                <br>
                What I saw: A need for a centralized, reliable platform for cultural education that users could take at their own pace. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The concept: A module-based educational platform that works with users at their own speed to dive into the history of their cultural identity that they were deprived of while growing up. Historicultural is an educational ecosystem that rewards users for their daily engagement while tracking users via "nontraditional" benchmarking such as a simple conversation with a friend about a module's topic. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The goal: With this concept, I wanted to provide an educational platform that users of any level could join while still incorporating a low level of community engagement. This concept is more information heavy for those that are less inclined to cold-contact those in their community.

            <p>
                After a class-wide review of the themes I produced in the ideation stage, I took into account feedback and developed wireframes accordingly. The winning theme was Crash Culture, but I incorporated features from all three concepts because I saw that it benefitted the medium of the Crash Culture concept while also not distracting from the core value of gamifying cultural immersion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The prototype has 5 main user flows: Onboarding, Question of the Day & Lifelines, Prompt of the Day, Friends Management, and Profile Management. All of these were made to support the goal of giving young immigrants the ability to immerse themselves in their culture and communities at their own pace while still being incentivized to return day after day.

                To round out the design process I was charged by my professor to test my prototype with at least five people who fit the testing requirements: young immigrants with access to technology. To do this, I created a link from the Adobe XD prototype and a Qualtrics survey to accompany it. I then posted it on my social media and included a small incentive of a $10 venmo raffle to encourage those in my network to participate towards the goal of having a testing sample size of at least 20 users.

                Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned
            </h1>
            <p>
                Overall, this project is the one on my portfolio I've derived the most value from on a personal level. Because it was an opportunity to pour my identity and passions into, I found myself working at it more dilligently and carefully than anything in the past. Crash Culture has taught me what project ownership can look like and how rewarding it can be. I was able to make my own decisions from empathy to testing and everything in between and implement ideas that were very representative of who I am as a person. Beyond the personal impact, I've developed new skills in Qualitative Research and Testing that I wasn't able to fully explore in my other portfolio projects due to constraints.

            <h2>
                Challenges I ran into
            </h2>
            <p>
                Because this project was so near and dear to my heart, I had to continuously remind myself to remain objective in my evaluation and synthesis of data collected at both the Empathy and Testing stages. I found myself getting lost in what the solution could look like as opposed to what my persona's needs were. To remedy this, I continously referred to exact quotes from interviews and asked for outside opinions to ensure that my work was still benefitting my intended user. Building out my user personas was essential to this process since they helped me prevent myself from falling into the Self-Referential design pitfall. I continuously adjusted my design process so that I could go back and check that my design decisions were aligning with the problems expressed in the data I collected to remain impartial. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                What I would do differently
            </h2>
            <p>
                To make this a more successful product, I would have taken more time to make the features more comprehensive in the interactive prototype prior to testing due to the fact that I felt that its limitations were preventing test users from immersing themselves in the experience I intended. This way, I would've been able to collect better data that would allow me to iterate the interactive prototype more efficiently.
