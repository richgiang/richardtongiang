            Crash Culture is an interactive, educational trivia game that provides users with a gateway to learning more about their identity day-by-day. Each day users are provided with a singular multiple-choice trivia question about a topic within their ethnic culture from food to language and more. Beyond the game, users are encouraged to engage more deeply with their identity either via conversations with peers in their community or learning through digital resources.

                    A gap between the increasing population of second-generation immigrants and their heritage is growing and preventing them from connecting with the culture of their parents leading to dissonance between their cultural identity and their newfound American identity. Currently, there does not exist a centralized digital resource for children of immigrants to reliably learn about the varying aspects of their identities.

                I was charged with approaching the Empathy phase of this iteration of the design process with qulitative methods, particularly with interviews to help inform the building of Empathy Maps, User Personas, and Current and Future States. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I conducted 9 in-depth interviews with those in my network that identified as either second-generation immigrants or first-generation immigrants that immigrated at a young age. In these interviews, I learned the stories of how younger immigrants are navigating the tumultuous journey of being part of a marginalized population in America. These personas are a culmination of their experiences, struggles, needs and frustrations.

            <p>
                After conducting interviews and performing online research, I developed themes that corresponded to each of the personas that embodied different demographics from my research. All of the themes were inspired by various applications that had various functions that I believed would benefit the intended users. These themes were then presented to my UI/UX Intermedia graduate-level class where I was questioneded about my choices and given feedback.

                Derived from: Persona 1
                <br>
                <br>
                Inspired by: Wordle (a daily word game) and BeReal (a social media based in organic content creation where users only post once-per-day)
                <br>
                <br>
                What I saw: A need for a low-commitment solution that users would still be incentivized to engage with to receive bits of information about their culture that have the potential to lead to deeper engagements. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The concept: A daily trivia game about one's culture that uses "Lifelines" that nudge users to engage with their community. Crash Culture is a daily gateway for users to explore their culture and connect with other cultural community members digitally, utlizing user's pre-existing networks while also expanding them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The goal: I wanted to pull from the low-stakes commitment of a short game once per day while having the brief, yet meaningful engagement of BeReal. This way there would be a level of flexibility allowing users to choose how in-depth they'd like to immerse themselves while still being motivated to move past the scary first steps.

                <br>
                What I saw: A group of young immigrants seeking deeper, intimate, and organic connections with those in their community. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The concept: Family Ties is a mobile app that sorts out users by demographic and locality then randomly generates groupchats and assigns relevant conversation prompts once per week. Users are then incentivized to remain connected with their weekly groupchats and even meet in person via a rewards system.
                <br>
                <br>
                The goal: I wanted to nudge users to connect with those in their cultural community that they come to like in a pseudo-groupchat-platonic-speeddating setting. With this, there would be opportunities for forming deep connections with those they may not have connected with in their community.

                <br>
                What I saw: A need for a centralized, reliable platform for cultural education that users could take at their own pace. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The concept: A module-based educational platform that works with users at their own speed to dive into the history of their cultural identity that they were deprived of while growing up. Historicultural is an educational ecosystem that rewards users for their daily engagement while tracking users via "nontraditional" benchmarking such as a simple conversation with a friend about a module's topic. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The goal: With this concept, I wanted to provide an educational platform that users of any level could join while still incorporating a low level of community engagement. This concept is more information heavy for those that are less inclined to cold-contact those in their community.

                Our team decided to develop a solution that serves as an augmentation to the current system. We recognized that Carmen Canvas has a robust system of coursework information storage so we merely wanted to integrate an improved method of professor-student communication and navigation of content as opposed to overhauling the entire system. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I undertook the task of visualizing our user workflow improvement suggestions in Figma. Over the course of two weeks I taught myself how to use basic Figma functions and plug-ins and combined my knowledge of Adobe products to create a functioning prototype. The prototype helped us demonstrate various user flows where we could directly tie user needs to.

                Our professor for Exploring Design Thinking, Adam Fromme, wanted to use our final presentations in place of our "Test" portion of the design process. Our professor's goal was to collect the best projects and present our findings to both the Chair of the Design Department as well as the Chief Wellness Officer at Ohio State. We compiled our prototype and accompanying slide deck and recorded a 15 minute presentation detailing our process at each step of the design process. Our professor had to say this about our final product:

                Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned

            <p>
                Upon reflection two years later, I realized that this was the beginning in which I understood how important following the design process can be. Not just following it in its straightforward approach, but being able to constantly challenge assumptions while also looping through the design process in different permutations. There were many times where we learned something new through and had to open discussion back up at all parts of the process, so I quickly grasped that the design process shouldn't necessarily be a step-by-step process but rather a framework or tool to apply when confronted with information, data, and stories.
