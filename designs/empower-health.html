            For summer of 2022 I've been contracted by a local Columbus startup called Empower Health that recently acquired funding through an accelerator to be their temporary UX Product Lead. Empower Health is a mobile application company focused on providing a digital community for those living with metabolic diseases. In this role I'm leading their efforts to better understand their user's stories and needs with the goal of producing a click-through prototype for MVP development by the end of my contract.
