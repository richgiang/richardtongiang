            In my "Presentation As Thinking" class for my Design Thinking minor we undertook the wicked problem of student workload and burnout in a semester-long project that taught me the value of UX Research and the process of empathy. With the overall theme of wellness at play, the top solutions from our class would be presented to Ohio State University's Chief Wellness Officer and the department chair of the Design School to be evaluated for implementation across departments.

            <p>
                Our team decided to pursue a mixed methods approach to research. Due to the breadth of the problem we needed to see what our target users, university students, associated with workload and burnout. To do this we first started with the quantiative research method of surveys to pinpoint trends that we could pursue. Over two weeks we received 117 responses and in our analysis of the data we found that the most interesting trends arose from the question "Do you feel more burnt out this semester compared to other semesters? Why or why not?" What we saw was that students were attributing feelings of burnout to a perceived surplus of unnecessary work brought on by the new virtual envrionment. We decided to dive deeper to these findings in qualitative interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                After performing 19 qualitative interviews exploring virtual burnout for students, we found a few trends that helped us narrow our focus: 
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="callout">
                    1. Students felt that they've been provided with more "busy work" in the new virtual envrionment and generally feel that the quality of their education has decreased leading to a lack of motivation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Students are suffering from a lack of structure in their due to mixed methods of delivery and no standardization. Because of instantaneous access to digital class content, they feel a constant influx of work and that there's always something to be done. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Students are tired of staring at a screen for hours on end without any structured breaks. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. Students feel as though the lack of dedicated times for face-to-face interactions with professors leads to unneeded stressors such as missed deadlines and lack of clarification.

            </h1>
            <p>
                After discovering the trends we came together to define our problem. Between the surveys and interviews a recurring topic was paint points in professor-student communication. Because of this we decided to look at the trends we found through the lens of professor-student communication and we reached this problem statement:
            </p>
            <p>
                <div class="callout">
                    Students are feeling burnt out due to a perceived increase in workload which is caused by low quality interactions with their professor in a wholly digital environment.
                </div>
            </p>
            <p >
                We then turned this problem statement into a "How might we?" statement:
            </p>
            <p>
                <div class="callout">
                    How might we increase the quality of interaction and communication between professors and students so that students can save time completing work for other activities that can boost their overall wellness while still receiving a high-quality education?
                </div> 
            </p> 
            <p>
                After this we broke down the central topic of our problem, professor-student communication, into a mindmap so that we could see the specificities in our wicked problem. Before this, to make sure we were headed down the write path we looked into empirical research in peer-reviewed articles to see if the current model of professor-student communication was already being researched for the sake of improvement.

                Ideate
            </h1>
            <p>
                After looking at all of the different pain points within student-professor communication we grouped them and began to brainstorm using the "Worst Possible Idea" method where we thought about what the worst case scenario could look like for each facet of the problem. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We then flipped our bad ideas around and turned them into their opposite which began to form ideas for features of our solution. After grouping them into categories we saw themes arise: 
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Balance in number of forms of communication.
                <br>
                2. Increased touchpoints and opportunities for communication from the professor.
                <br>
                3. Something simple and easy to use that doesn't require strong motivation and reduces time at the screen.
                <br>
                4. Access to multiple methods of collaboration between students. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some specific features that arose were:
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Easy methods for booking office hour appointments
                <br>
                2. A method of feedback for individual assignments
                <br>
                3. A medium of communication for students to ask clarifying questions without compromising classroom integrity
                <br>
                4. An integrated calendar for all assignments, office hours, and events
                <br>
                5. Weekly notifications of new assignments
            </p>

                Prototype
            </h1>
            <p>
                We decided that since our users and students and must use virtual communication methods due to the pandemic that our product would best be delivered as a web-based app for mobile devices. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Given that I was the most well-versed in prototyping methods I undertook the task of visualizing our product in Figma (although prior I had no prior experience with the software). Over the course of two weeks I taught myself how to use Figma and combined my knowledge of Adobe products to create a functioning prototype.
