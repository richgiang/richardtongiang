            In my "Presentation As Thinking" class for my Design Thinking minor we undertook the wicked problem of student workload and burnout in a semester-long project that taught me the value of UX Research and the process of empathy. With the overall theme of wellness at play, the top solutions from our class would be presented to Ohio State University's Chief Wellness Officer and the department chair of the Design School to be evaluated for implementation across departments.

                <p>
                    Our team decided to pursue a mixed methods approach to research. First we built a user survey and in two weeks we received 117 responses. From this, we found that the most interesting trends arose from the question "Do you feel more burnt out this semester compared to other semesters? Why or why not?" We saw that students were attributing feelings of burnout to a perceived surplus of unnecessary work brought on by the new virtual environment. We decided to dive deeper to these findings in qualitative interviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After following up and conducting 19 in-depth qualitative interviews, we found a few trends that helped us narrow our focus:

                    1. Students felt they've been given more "busy work" and generally feel that the quality of their education has decreased leading to a lack of motivation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Students are suffering from a lack of structure in their education due to mixed methods of delivery and no standardization.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Students are tired of staring at a screen for hours on end without any structured breaks.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. Students feel as though the lack of dedicated time for face-to-face interactions with professors leads to missed deadlines and lack of clarification.

                <p>
                    After discovering the trends we came together to define our problem. Between the surveys and interviews a recurring motif revolved around paint points in professor-student communication. We knew we had to narrow down the problem since there were too many avenues to pursue in the short amount of time we had. What we saw that these students were telling us was that they were looking for the most efficient means to engage with their professors to reduce instances of unneeded stress or lost time. Because of this we decided to look at the trends we found through the lens of the model of professor-student communication and we reached this problem statement:
                </p>
                <div class="callout-container">
                    <div class="callout-body-carmen">

                </div>
                <p>
                    With this problem statement we were able to narrow in on a solution space that would allow us to tackle multiple painpoints within one product. We then turned this problem statement into a "How might we?" statement:
                </p>
                <div class="callout-container">
                    <div class="callout-body-carmen">
                        <span class="carmen-type">HOW MIGHT WE?</span>
                        <div></div>
                        How might we reimagine the student-professor communication framework so that students can have as rich of an educational experience as possible without unneeded stressors?
                    </div>
                </div>  
                <p>
                    Using a Mind Map on Miro, we took apart the model of professor-student communication and broke it down into core functions such as Assignment Clarification, Feedback, Notification, User Availability, and more.  We then broke those categories down into specific statements of need or problems that we noticed from our surveys and interviews such as: "Notifications from current system are not helpful and often redundant" and "Communicating hours of availability outside of lecture and office hours". 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To assess current research on professor-student communication models we looked to peer-reviewed articles. What we found was that with email, "Professor email helpfullness, reply promptness, and email frequency for social-relationship were the most significant predictors of both professor-student relationship and teaching evaluation" (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/EC.37.3.d">Fung & Sheer, 2007</a>). From this we took away that the experience for both students and professors improves when there is a certain level of social telepresence in communication, so we thought it would be good to revamp and re-evaluate that model and the current mediums associated with it. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    The current model of communication at Ohio State is Carmen Canvas (Instructure). Within this system, professors host nearly all aspects of their courses from syllabi to assignments and quizzes to embedded media to discussion boards. While this system hosts online coursework well, it lacks interactivity that is essential to a virutal educational experience. Essentially, this system excels in being a bank of information but when used as a conduit between student in professor it lacks in any meaningful or helpful connection.

                    There's no dedicated method of feedback from student-to-professor, discussion threads don't produce organic communication that's beneficial to students, and the calendar feature isn't fully utilized due to its lack of cross-platform integration.
                </div>
                <div class="tldr-description-carmen">
                    <p>
                        In the current system the only time to get specific feedback on assignments between professors and students is in the comments of the specific assignment. Aside from initial feedback, professors tend to not engage with students within the comments and usually prompt them to follow-up via office hours introducing the need to externalize communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discussion posts are the only time to have class-wide communication, but to initiate conversation students need to go through the process of making a whole posts without being able to just send a quick message. The current practice is to use this feature for assignment-based discussions where students are graded on their "engagement" as opposed to organic communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within the calendar feature, students are unable to sync, import, or share external calendars which prevents them from adding student organization, internship, research, or work calendars that may be used on other platforms. Only 3% of our respondents indicated that they solely use the Carmen Canvas calendar for organziation.

                    Notifications channels are flooded with duplicated and spam information that deters students from actively engaging with information that is actually useful leading to unneeded stressors.

                        Within Carmen Canvas the communication between professors and students primarily exists between three features. The message inbox effectively serves as an email function in which professors and students can send mass or direct messages to specific groups or individuals. This feature fails to serve as an effective communication method due to the inability to view past messages in a thread or view messages from other individuals in the contact list. In addition, mass messsages are often spammed due to the access to group lists deterring students from actively engaging. The to-do list is an auto-populated list of assignments from all classes that are removed once submitted. This feature duplicates something that the calendar feature already does leading to unneccessary information. In addition, announcements from professors can be seen both here and on specific class pages, leading to more information duplication.

                    After looking at all of the different pain points within student-professor communication we grouped them and began to brainstorm using the "Worst Possible Idea" method where we thought about what the worst case scenario could look like for each facet of the problem.

                <p>
                    We then flipped our bad ideas around and turned them into their opposite which began to form ideas for features of our solution. After grouping them into categories we saw themes arise:

                    From this we began to build out our vision for a comprehensive digital ecosystem that could serve as a one-stop-shop for students to answer their questions about assignments while filling in the affordances that are missed in the transition from a physical to a digital classroom. We believed that building out a "Channel" of communication similar to Slack and Discord, would allow students to communicate with professors in a more flat environment and focused on developing specific features that would be conducive to an educational context. Some specific features that arose were:

                    Our team decided to develop a solution that serves as an augmentation to the current system.

                    I undertook the task of visualizing our user workflow improvement suggestions in Figma. Over the course of two weeks I taught myself how to use basic Figma functions and plug-ins and combined my knowledge of Adobe products to create a functioning prototype. The prototype helped us demonstrate various user flows where we could directly tie user needs to.

                    We implemented the Announcements feature to streamline communication from professors to the entire class. This function works in tandem with the group messaging flow as the only two methods of communication. With Announcements, professors can abstract questions they see pop up in the chat into class-wide announcements if they deem it important enough. Lastly, announcements are searchable if a student needs fast access to specific information.

                    This flow has three important concepts and features that alleviate students' painpoints. The first being the cross-platform calendar that allows students to sync their Google, Apple, or Outlook calendars. This prevents students from having to add their assignments, exams, and projects into their own calendars or planners manually. Furthermore, the depth of automatic assignment-specific reminders is especially beneficial since professors usually have to do this manually through email and Carmen Canvas announcements.

                     A majority of our survey respondents expressed frustration with virtual curriculum and perceived "busy work". We believed that a dedicated system for feedback and polling could help both professors and students find common ground on assignments. The Feedback system allows students to submit qualitative feedback via comments on their assignments to express concerns or gain clarity. The Polling system allows for quantiative data to be collected about any assignment allowing professors to quickly see trends and make decisions about how to address it. Typically, these interactions are facilitated via disparate communication methods but with the ability to submit feedback and poll the class, students can now voice their concerns more accessibly.

                    Our professor for Exploring Design Thinking, Adam Fromme, wanted to use our final presentations in place of our "Test" portion of the design process. Our professor's goal was to collect the best projects and present our findings to both the Chair of the Design Department as well as the Chief Wellness Officer at Ohio State. We compiled our prototype and accompanying slide deck and recorded a 15 minute presentation detailing our process at each step of the design process. Our professor had to say this about our final product:

                        "Team, great job. Your group was one of my top three for this term. The reason for this that not only did you have a clear line between your problem and your solution, but you were able to present it in as very easys to follow presentation format. Well done. Two of the specific features of your Carmen Classrooms that I liked were the Digital Office Hours scheduling blocks and the 2 methods for Feedback. Overall great presentation, well done."

                    In the ensuing weeks our professor forwarded our recorded presentations to the persons of interest and the following semester we saw a lo-fi solution be implemented into classes that were strictly virtual in format: Discord channels. With these Discord channels professors were able to set a common language for classroom communication and be more present for more pertinent questions. It was an appropriate introduction to a closer, flatter communication model between professors and students. Something to hopefully relieve the stress, burnout, and workload of Ohio State's students.

                <p>
                    Upon reflection two years later, I realized that this was the beginning in which I understood that to properly design you must be able to constantly challenge assumptions while also looping through the design process in different permutations. There were many times where we learned something new and had to open discussion back up at all parts of the process, so I quickly grasped that the design process shouldn't necessarily be a step-by-step process but rather a framework or tool to apply when confronted with information, data, and stories.

                            A challenge that arose early was the issue of breaking down the wicked problem of student burnout and workload into something that was manageable within the time frame that we had. In this, I learned that oftentimes designers have to be light on their feet and adjust to what potential users are saying, instead of trying to break it down on our own we let our potentialy users do it for us. We focused heavily on the empathy stage so that we could quickly and thoroughly identify a more specific problem that we could produce a usable solution for. With this, we were able to discern trends in their painpoints and develop features in our solution that corresponded directly.

                            Given more time I would have interviewed professors more in-depth. We realized towards the end of our research phase that we didn't dedicate enough time towards the other half of stakeholders in this solution, we only had informal conversations with a few of our own professors instead of comprehensive mixed methods research. If we worked more closely with a larger population of professors our solution would have been more robust in terms of the professor experience, leading to a solution that would ultimately have a better user experience. Furthermore, we would have benefitted from testing the solution with our survey respondents so that we could iteratively prototype and be able to deliver a properly validated solution to the Chief Wellness Officer.

                            Currently, as we transition back to in-person classes, versions of our solution seem to still hold up. Professors are more actively engaging in the creation of class groupchats and being more attentive to the needs of students in the virtual environment. In addition, more methods of feedback are encouraged throughout curriculum. A solution such as this has personal ties to my own struggle with burnout and workload. As someone who has never had the proper resources to deal with the negative side affects of burnout, I'm glad to be able to provide a solution that can help improve the mental and emotional wellness of my peers.
