                    Kroger delivered more than $11B in online sales in 2020 on its way to becoming the 9th largest E-Commerce business in America. How does Kroger maintain growth and sustain its positioning as a top E-Commerce business in the United States as the country heads toward a more normalized future? After completing a thorough evaluation of the Kroger site experience - how does it compare to rest of market (grocery & general merch)?

                    First, we grasped the current market competition for digital grocery retail and benchmarked Kroger against its competitors. Additionally, we did research on general market and website trends in this space. Here, our goal was to step into the shoes of Kroger's current and future customers through data.

                    My team wanted to go beyond the challenge prompt and explore not only what the current and future landscape were projected to be, but what that could actually look like for Kroger. We wanted to truly innovate their site experience and build out a vision conducive to Kroger's goals.

                    Myself and Evan Turner developed prototypes of two potential future states of Kroger's site experience. First, I produced set of high-fidelity Figma wireframes that mapped out the user experience in a hybrid state. Second, Evan produced a virtual experience using the Three.js framework that visualized what Kroger's far off future state could look like.

                    What was evident across our competitive analysis was that all online grocery retailers are operating within the e-commerce framework built by Amazon. Being that Amazon started as an online-only experience they were uniquely positioned to pioneer what e-commerce looked like. However, we believed that Kroger and other grocers that started in the physical space weren't capitalizing on the wealth of knowledge they've developed over decades of in person shopping experience research.

                        Kroger's current and potential customers value a shopping experience that prioritizes overall convenience more than anything else. All grocery retailers including Kroger are attempting to out-compete Amazon in a space where Amazon built the standard. They are missing an opportunity to bridge their physical and digital spaces in a way that plays into their unique advantage: proprietary in person shopping research.

                During our research we had two insights that led us to producing a product that could help the Kroger team envision what capturing their online shopping growth could look like. First, we learned that a majority of shoppers still very much prefer shopping in person for groceries when they can. What dictates their choices is convenience. Second, we learned that Kroger has conducted an overwhelming amount or proprietary research on in person shopper behavior and is underutilizing it when it comes to their digital shopping experience.

We called it the <span class="kroger-type | module-bold">MyKroger experience</span>.

                With these features in mind we broke the prototype into two states. The first, a high-fidelity mockup of a mobile app that embodies the idea of a personalized MyKroger digital experience incorporating Kroger's proprietary research on in-person shopping behavior (made by myself in Figma). The second, a virtual experience built in Three.js that embodies a more distant future state in which Kroger has fully implemented their in person shopping research into an immersive virtual reality product (made by Evan Turner in VS Code).

                    My teammate built this bare bones experience to help the Kroger team step into the vision that we had for Kroger's website experience far future state in which users would be enveloped into a completely virtual experience - a vision our research proved Kroger's competitors are heading towards.

                </h1>
                As Project Manager, I led the team in the development of our presentation narrative. We crafted a user persona based on our Market Research and used our User Journey to walk the Kroger team through what a use case could look like with the MyKroger experience. Our presentation had two main components, a highlight review of our three main categories of research insight: Personalization, Transparency, and Digitization followed by a product demo. Lastly, we laid out a timeline of implementation.

                Our team won the consulting challenged judged by a panel of Kroger employees from both their site development and marketing teams. The panel had this to say about the results:

                        "The two teams up for final consideration were Team Garrett and Team Richard. The decision was really close and specifically came down to whether Kroger wanted to be able to implement recommendations that would put them on par with their competition or help them outshine the competition. Ultimately, the Kroger Team felt like the creativity and sophistication of Team Richard's recommendations would help elevate them to the next level."

                <h1>Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned</h1>
                Reflecting on the Kroger challenge, while we were successful in the competition, there were plenty of areas of improvement for myself as a UX Designer as well as a Project Manager.

                        <p>
                            In anticipation of my team member's busy schedules, I provided two days for meetings for progresss check-ins. This proved to cause miscommunication due to mismatched schedules. Next time, I'll work with my team to implement a consistent schedule where everyone is on the same page. In addition, due to the nature of intellectual property at Kroger, we had a few gaps in our research which we attempted to fill with general market reports. Since empathy and research is so crucial to the design process, next time I'll work with my team to allot more time to conducting use research to produce at least three user personas to get a more holistic picture.

                            In addition to being a project manager, I learned how to apply theories and skills learned in my HCI curriculum to real-world problems from conception to fruition. I combined my Visual design, UX design, and Research skills to bring to life my team's shared vision and seeing the results in both our win and the faces of my teammates have helped me find fullfilment and motivation in this field of work.

                        <p>
                            Kroger is the 21st largest company in the United States, and we were in a unique position in which we could make tangible change within a large company's vision. By going above and beyond the charge, my team was able to provide the added value of challenging Kroger's marketing team in their current assumptions of what the digital grocery landscape should look like. As project manager, I served to bring out the best possible solution from my team's diverse backgrounds to produce a unqiue solution that Kroger couldn't receive anywhere else.
