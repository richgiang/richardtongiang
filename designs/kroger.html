                From classroom to workplace

            <p>
                During the Spring 2021 semester, I enrolled in a class with the express purpose of developing front-end development skills to bolster my ability to prototype and operate within the user experience and user interface design space. This class takes an unconventional look at coding from an artistic perspective. My instructors front-loaded the class with fast-paced exercises producing a baseline understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Later on, our skills would be developed in 1:1 sessions during the development of our projects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At the introduction of our fourth project we were tasked with developing a homepage for an organization we were associated with. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to practice my skills within my work environment as the Managing Editor for Design for the Lantern. Coincidentally, we had plans to collaborate with the BLACK X BOLD Magazine in honor of Black History Month to produce a collection of stories honoring the narratives of diverse successes within the Black Community at Ohio State University. I took the opportunity to spearhead an idea for a homepage that the project could live on and create an overarching brand for the project to extend into social media promotion.
