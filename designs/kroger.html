                    Kroger delivered more than $11B in online sales in 2020 on its way to becoming the 9th largest E-Commerce business in America. How does Kroger maintain growth and sustain its positioning as a top E-Commerce business in the United States as the country heads toward a more normalized future? After completing a thorough evaluation of the Kroger site experience - how does it compare to rest of market (grocery & general merch)?

                The idea behind MyKroger was to produce a highly personalized and immersive shopping experience that implements all of the research conducted by Kroger on in-person shopping into their digital experience. Our goal was to work with Kroger and their users to turn the digital grocery shopping experience into something that could accommodate the boom during the pandemic that accelerated projections for digital retail growth.

                    First, we grasped the current market competition for digital grocery retail and benchmarked Kroger against its competitors. Additionally, we did research on general market and website trends in this space. Here, our goal was to step into the shoes of Kroger's current and future customers through data.

                    </h2>
                    My team wanted to go beyond the challenge prompt and explore not only what the current and future landscape were projected to be, but what that could actually look like for Kroger. We wanted to truly innovate their site experience and build out a vision conducive to Kroger's goals.

                    Myself and Evan Turner developed prototypes of two potential future states of Kroger's site experience. First, I produced set of high-fidelity Figma wireframes that mapped out the user experience in a hybrid state. Second, Evan produced a virtual experience using the Three.js framework that visualized what Kroger's eventual future state could look like.

I led the development of the narrative structure and visual design of the slide deck. Our team ended up placing first out of five teams.

                Kroger is only matching their competitors in terms of overall site experience. There's no clear current practice that sets Kroger apart from other online grocery retailers. Simultaneously, Kroger's current and potential customers value a shopping experience that prioritizes overall convenience more than anything else.

                    Part 2: Going Further
                </h1>
                During our research we had two insights that led us to producing a product that could help the Kroger team envision what capturing their online shopping growth could look like. First, we learned that a majority of shoppers still very much prefer shopping in person for groceries when they can. Second, we learned that Kroger has conducted an overwhelming amount or proprietary research on in person shopper behavior. 
                <h2 class="callout-padding">
                    Our team linked these two pieces of information and set out to explore solutions that could bridge these ideas while catering to the needs users expressed during our market research: Personalization, Transparency, and Digitization.
                </h2>
                The solution we arrived at was to implement Kroger's already successful in person shopping experience into a digital setting retaining only the good parts while improving upong the experience with technological affordances. We called it the <span class="module-bold">MyKroger experience</span>.
