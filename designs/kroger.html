                    Kroger delivered more than $11B in online sales in 2020 on its way to becoming the 9th largest E-Commerce business in America. How does Kroger maintain growth and sustain its positioning as a top E-Commerce business in the United States as the country heads toward a more normalized future? After completing a thorough evaluation of the Kroger site experience - how does it compare to rest of market (grocery & general merch)?

                    First, we grasped the current market competition for digital grocery retail and benchmarked Kroger against its competitors.

                    My team wanted to go beyond the challenge prompt and explore not only what the current and future landscape were projected to be, but what that could actually look like for Kroger. We wanted to truly innovate their site experience and build out a vision conducive to Kroger's goals.

First, I produced set of high-fidelity Figma wireframes that mapped out the user experience in a hybrid state. Second, Evan produced a virtual experience using the Three.js framework that visualized what Kroger's eventual future state could look like.

Many of the leading grocery retailers quickly adopted the algorithmically-driven design that Amazon began to perfect years before competitors created an online presence.

                    What was evident across our competitive analysis was that all online grocery retailers are operating within the e-commerce framework built by Amazon. Being that Amazon started as an online-only experience they were uniquely positioned to pioneer what e-commerce looked like. However, we believed that Kroger and other grocers that started in the physical space weren't capitalizing on the wealth of knowledge they've developed over decades of in person shopping experience research.

                Kroger is only matching their competitors in terms of overall site experience. There's no clear current practice that sets Kroger apart from other online grocery retailers. Simultaneously, Kroger's current and potential customers value a shopping experience that prioritizes overall convenience more than anything else. All grocery retailers including Kroger are attempting to out-compete Amazon in a space where Amazon built the standard. They are missing an opportunity to bridge their physical and digital spaces in a way that plays into their unique advantage: proprietary in person shopping research.

                During our research we had two insights that led us to producing a product that could help the Kroger team envision what capturing their online shopping growth could look like. First, we learned that a majority of shoppers still very much prefer shopping in person for groceries when they can. What dictates their choices is convenience. Second, we learned that Kroger has conducted an overwhelming amount or proprietary research on in person shopper behavior and is underutilizing it when it comes to their digital shopping experience. 
                <h2 class="callout-padding">
                    Our team linked these two pieces of information and set out to explore solutions that could bridge these ideas while catering to the needs users expressed during our market research: Personalization, Transparency, and Digitization.

                The solution we arrived at was to implement Kroger's already successful in person shopping experience into a digital setting retaining only the good parts while improving upon the experience with technological affordances.

                With these features in mind we broke the prototype into two states. The first, a high-fidelity mockup of a mobile app that embodies the idea of a personalized MyKroger digital experience incorporating Kroger's proprietary research on in-person shopping behavior (made by myself in Figma). The second, a virtual experience built in Three.js that embodies a more distant future state in which Kroger has fully implemented their in person shopping research into an immersive virtual reality product (made by Evan Turner in VS Code).

                Three weeks before our deadline, I led the team in the development of our presentation narrative. We crafted a user persona based on our Market Research and used our User Journey to walk the Kroger team through what a use case could look like with the MyKroger experience. Our presentation had two main components, a highlight review of our three main categories of research insight: Personalization, Transparency, and Digitization followed by a product demo. Lastly, we laid out a timeline of implementation.

                Our team won the consulting challenged judged by a panel of Kroger employees from both their site development and marketing teams. The panel had this to say about the results: 
                <h2 class="callout-padding">
                    "The two teams up for final consideration were Team Garrett and Team Richard. The decision was really close and specifically came down to whether Kroger wanted to be able to implement recommendations that would put them on par with their competition or help them outshine the competition. Ultimately, the Kroger Team felt like the creativity and sophistication of Team Richard's recommendations would help elevate them to the next level."

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                Reflecting on the Kroger challenge, while we were successful in the competition, there were plenty of areas of improvement for myself as a UX Designer as well as a Project Manager.
                <h3 class="padding2">Challenges we ran into & What I'd do differently</h3>
                In anticipation of my team member's busy schedules, I provided two days for meetings in which they could check in, report their work, and work with me or my assistant project manager to establish new goals for the upcoming week. This proved to cause miscommunication due to the inconsistency of days people showed up to meetings. Next time, I'll work with my team to implement a consistent scheudle where everyone is on the same page.

                In addition, due to the nature of intellectual property at Kroger, we weren't able to access a lot of user data. This caused a few gaps in our research which we attempted to fill with general market reports. We also recognized that we did not have time to recruit survey respondents that would be diverse enough in background to prove useful. Since empathy and research is so crucial to the design process, next time I'll work with my team to allot more time and resources to ensuring we have as comprehensive of an understanding of our client's users as possible. Specifically, conducting mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to produce at least three user personas would help with this. 
                <h3 class="padding2">What I learned</h3>
                In addition to being a project manager, I learned how to apply theories and skills learned in my HCI curriculum to real-world problems from conception to fruition. I combined my Visual design, UX design, and Research skills to bring to life my team's shared vision and seeing the results in both our win and the faces of my teammates have helped me find fullfilment and motivation in this field of work. 
                <h3 class="padding2">Why it matters to me</h3>
                This project was the first time the underclassmen in our program participated in a consulting challenge. I wanted to set the tone for them for the program and make sure that while they were delivering high quality solutions for our clients, they were also taking the time to connect with one another in a wholly remote environment. This program has given me more than I can put into words, and I want them to have as rewarding of an experience. In my meetings I tried to lighten the conversation and encourage teammates to meet 1:1 outside of the professional environment.
