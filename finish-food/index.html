                My name is Richard Ton Giang and I'm the son of Vietnamese refugees. Growing up with the self-perception of being "the other" built up by "minor feelings" led me to cling onto my identity through a simple phrase: Finish Your Food. Over the years this mantra has cultivated three distinct meanings for myself: Take advantage of every opportunity, never forget where I've come from, and always finish what I've started.

                    My parents were forced from their homes in South Vietnam during post-war reconstruction. Along with leaving behind everything they owned they also left behind their identities. All the while, a result of the trauma would slowly take form in emboldened negative feelings towards anything that reminded them of what was stripped of them. The culmination of their resentment and erasure of their past would completely shape my upbringing in rural-suburban Ohio. As I grew up in a predominantly-white suburb, I noticed that I was stuck between being villified or tokenized for my identity. This resulted in my

I believed there would be no conflict if I simply opted to toss identity to the side. I was successful up until college where I was enveloped in a new environment and a new digital social landscape. My identity as an Asian American and child of immigrant was becoming mainstream and I didn't know what to do. Suddenly, I was faced with an entirely new internal conflict, Identity Imposter Syndrome. With the rise of Asian and Asian American prominence in mainstream culture,

                    I suddenly felt encouraged to embrace my identity but didn't know how to. It wasn't until I saw the intersection of storytelling, design, and most importantly, food, that I was able to grasp what it meant to be Asian in America. Being that food was the only thing I was able to hold onto from my culture, it quickly became the vehicle for my own identity exploration. As I honed skills as a designer and knowledge of food as a means towards empathy, I saw how my own story could influence my work and consequently my impact. One of the most important skills a designer needs is empathy,

Today, I work as a designer that operates with the lessons I've learned through reconciling my cultural identity through food stories. Because of this, I'm obsessed with the stories and experiences of others, I'm relentlessly and curiously pursuing my potential, I'm developing products that add everyday value to those from all backgrounds, and I'm finishing my food.

                        Here's a picture of me delivering my TEDx talk titled "Reconciling my Cultural Identity through Food Stories" at TEDxOhioStateUniversity's Bloom Main Event on February 26th, 2022. Unfortunately, the video is still being approved by "Big TED" to be published on their official TEDx Youtube Channel so there's no link yet, but I'd still love to talk about it :)

                    I'm kind of obsessed with all things food from cooking with my closest friends to going on food adventures in new cities to binging food documentaries. My relationship with food and how closely it's tied into my identity give me an interesting perspective when approaching the design process. I fully believe that those who produce the labor of love and identity that is cooking the food of their culture are masters of user experience. From empathy to prototyping to testing, they dilligently and graciously make changes for the sole purpose of ensuring that their customers not only enjoy their food but gain an appreciation for the depths of the stories that lie behind the dishes that allows them to empathize. This is the level of care for the stories of both my own and those I work with that I bring to every problem that I'm asked to solve. So whether you'd like to work with me or just share a meal, I'd love to get to know your story.
