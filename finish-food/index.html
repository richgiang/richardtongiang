                To me, the phrase, <span>“Finish your food”</span> has three distinct meanings. The first: <span>take advantage of every opportunity</span> because I often don't realize the lengths others and myself have gone through to get them, so eat while it lasts. The second: <span>never forget the stories that make up who I am</span>. They're learning opportunities that can't be replaced, so be thankful for who made the food and the ingredients they used. The last: <span>to always finish what I've started</span>. I don't know where I'm headed but I can focus on what's in front of me and how I can contribute the deep perspective I've continuously developed into every conversation, so I will always savor every last bite.

                    I'm kind of obsessed with all things food from cooking with my closest friends to going on food adventures in new cities to binging food documentaries. My relationship with food and how closely it's tied to my identity give me an interesting perspective when approaching the design process. I fully believe that those who produce the labor of love and identity that is cooking the food of their culture are masters of user experience.

                    From empathy to prototyping to testing, they dilligently and graciously make changes for the sole purpose of ensuring that their customers not only enjoy their food but gain an appreciation for the depths of the stories behind every dish they can empathize with. This is the level of care for the stories of those I work with that I bring to every problem that I set out to solve.

                <div class="finish-description">
                    My parents were forced from their homes in South Vietnam during post-war reconstruction. Along with leaving behind everything they owned they also left behind their identities. All the while, a result of the trauma would slowly take form in emboldened negative feelings towards anything that reminded them of what was stripped of them. The culmination of their resentment and erasure of their past would completely shape my upbringing in rural-suburban Ohio. As I grew up in a predominantly-white suburb, I noticed that I was stuck between being villified or tokenized for my identity. This resulted in my subconscious decision to whitewash myself and diminish the parts of myself that revealed my "otherness". I believed there would be no conflict if I simply opted to toss identity to the side.

                     I was successful up until college where I was enveloped in a new environment and a new digital social landscape. My identity as an Asian American and child of immigrant was becoming mainstream and I didn't know what to do. Suddenly, I was faced with an entirely new internal conflict, Identity Imposter Syndrome. With the rise of Asian and Asian American prominence in mainstream culture, I suddenly felt encouraged to embrace my identity but didn't know how to. It wasn't until I saw the intersection of storytelling, design, and most importantly, food, that I was able to grasp what it meant to be Asian in America. Being that food was the only thing I was able to hold onto from my culture, it quickly became the vehicle for my own identity exploration.

                <div class="finish-description">
                    As I honed skills as a designer and knowledge of food as a means towards empathy, I saw how my own story could influence my work and consequently my impact. One of the most important skills a designer needs is empathy,  and there's no better way to put yourself in the shoes of others than through a shared meal. Today, I work as a designer that operates with the lessons I've learned through reconciling my cultural identity through food stories. Because of this, I'm obsessed with the stories and experiences of others, I'm relentlessly and curiously pursuing my potential, I'm developing products that add everyday value to those from all backgrounds, and I'm finishing my food.
